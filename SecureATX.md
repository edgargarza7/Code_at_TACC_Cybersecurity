# SecureATX Capstone Project

## Introduction
As we go on our journey to become ethical digital citizens and we have committed to the ethical hacking pledge, one thing we can do is to communicate what we learned during camp to our peers, parents, and the general public.

Each student group will work to create an internet safety public service announcement (PSA) based on a research topic, in addition, they must define and "threat model" the internet safety-related topic. Your counselors will work with you and guide you, although this is primarily an independent project you will be able to discuss ideas, topics, etc., with your peers and staff.

## Research Topics

| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Password Attacks | Social Media | Phishing | System Hardening |
| Internet of Things (IoT) | Mobile Apps | Cyberbullying | Video Games | 
| Online Presence| Privacy |
 

## Project Format
The public service announcement (PSA) will have a presentation component (3-5 slides) and a creative component (e.g., TikTok-style video, digital poster, social media post, etc.).

You can see an example of what information to put in the presentation:

## Presentation Format
On the last day of camp, we will host a closing ceremony where parents, friends, and external partners are invited to learn more about Code@TACC Cybersecurity and watch the students present their projects. Each group will have 5 minutes total to present their topic (slides) and their creative component.
